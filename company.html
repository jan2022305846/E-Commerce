        Since 1969, Mr. Abu-abu embarked on his entrepreneurial journey, initially operating a modest enterprise specializing in the finest cow leather within the vicinity of Misamis Occidental.

          Started from cow leather, Mr. Abu-abu ran his business with passion and dedication. 
          As demand grew, he expanded his offerings to include new leather variants like crocodile leather, 
          python leather, and ostrich leather, sourcing the finest materials from around the world. 
          Additionally, he diversified his product line, introducing new leather products such as belts,
          key holders, and bespoke accessories. Today, Abu-abu Leatherworks Co. stands as a testament to
          innovation and excellence in the leather industry.
